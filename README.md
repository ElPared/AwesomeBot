The best Discord bot!
---------------------

*Hello, I'm AwesomeBot. I add tons of cool stuff to any Discord server, providing external content, acting as a mod, and talking to members*

That's right! *The best Discord bot! I add tons of cool stuff to any Discord server, providing external content, acting as a mod, and talking to members*

AwesomeBot is an all-in-one Discord bot packed with features, written in NodeJS and using the Discord.JS third-party API. Here are some of the things he can get from around the web:

 - Images and GIFs
 - YouTube videos
 - RSS/Reddit posts
 - Wikipedia articles
 - Stock symbols
 - Twitter timelines
 - Mobile app links
 - MSN Weather forecast
 - Wolfram|Alpha data
 - Urban Dictionary terms
 - Google search results
 
In addition, he has many built-in utility functions:

 - Natural language unit conversion
 - Random number generator
 - Discord user profile
 - Server game list
 - Reminders via PM
 - Year countdown
 - Stats for members, games, and commands

And finally, AwesomeBot can conduct **in-chat polls**, offers a fun **live trivia game**, and provides **karma for Discord**. He is fully configurable via private message or online, and can be controlled independently between servers. New servers can be added with Discord OAuth, and admins are automatically detected.
